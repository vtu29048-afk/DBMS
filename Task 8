Normalizing Databases Using Functional Dependencies up to
BCNF
Objective:
To normalize the database created in Task-2 using functional dependencies (FDs) and apply
normalization techniques up to BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form).
1. Apply the Functional Dependency and Normalize to 1NF
Step 1: Identify Functional Dependencies (FDs)
Consider the following relations and FDs:
OrderTable (Order_ID, Cust_ID, Order_Date, Order_Total, Payment_Status)
 FD1: Order_ID → Cust_ID, Order_Date, Order_Total, Payment_Status
Customer (Cust_ID, Cust_Name, Cust_Contact, Cust_Email, Cust_Address)
 FD2: Cust_ID → Cust_Name, Cust_Contact, Cust_Email, Cust_Address
Menu_Item (Item_ID, Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID)
 FD3: Item_ID → Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID
Normalization to 1NF (First Normal Form)
 Ensure that each column contains only atomic (indivisible) values.
 Remove any repeating groups.
 Example:
Order_ID Cust_ID Order_Date Order_Total Payment_Status
1 1 2025-01-20 800 Paid
2 2 2025-01-21 500 Unpaid
2. Normalize the Relations Using FD+ and α+
 Compute FD+ (Closure of FDs) using Armstrong’s Axioms.
 Identify minimal keys and remove redundant FDs.
Closure for OrderTable:
 FD+: { Order_ID → Cust_ID, Order_Date, Order_Total, Payment_Status }
Closure for Customer:
 FD+: { Cust_ID → Cust_Name, Cust_Contact, Cust_Email, Cust_Address }
Closure for Menu_Item:
 FD+: { Item_ID → Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID }
3. Find the Minimal Cover and Canonical Cover
Minimal Cover:
 FD1: Order_ID → Cust_ID, Order_Date, Order_Total, Payment_Status
 FD2: Cust_ID → Cust_Name, Cust_Contact, Cust_Email, Cust_Address
 FD3: Item_ID → Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID
Canonical Cover:
 No redundancy detected.
4. Normalize to 2NF
 A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and has no partial dependencies.
 Remove partial dependencies by creating separate relations.
Normalization to 2NF:
 OrderTable (Order_ID, Order_Date, Order_Total, Payment_Status)
 Customer (Cust_ID, Cust_Name, Cust_Contact, Cust_Email, Cust_Address)
 Menu_Item (Item_ID, Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID)
5. Normalize to 3NF
 A relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies.
 Ensure non-prime attributes depend only on primary keys.
Normalization to 3NF:
 Restaurant (Rest_ID, Rest_Name, Rest_Location, Rest_Contact)
 Menu_Item (Item_ID, Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID)
6. Normalize to BCNF
 A relation is in BCNF if, for every functional dependency (X → Y), X is a super key.
 Identify and remove transitive dependencies.
Normalization to BCNF:
 OrderTable (Order_ID, Cust_ID, Order_Date, Order_Total, Payment_Status)
 Customer (Cust_ID, Cust_Name, Cust_Contact, Cust_Email, Cust_Address)
Menu_Item (Item_ID, Item_Name, Price, Category, Rest_ID)
